### Results
*We found empirical support for Hypothesis. The number of females who purchased the product are more than number of  males who purchased the product.
### Conclusion
*This paper was motivated by the need for research that could improve our understanding of how social advertising can affect the purchase of product based on age, gender and estimated salary of a person. The unique contribution of this paper is that we investigated the number of males and females who purchased the product through social network advertisements. We observed the number of females are larger than males who purchased the product.
